# UDF Examples for Spark SQL

UDF Examples for Spark SQL

## ExampleUDF

This is a hive udf. 

Hive UDF's can be used in Spark SQL, without modification. 

It is important to note that for performance reasons you may choose to re-implement your hive udf's as spark udf's when migrating from hadoop to spark sql. This example is meant to provide a demonstration that the functionality is supported, not as a recommendation. 

Not sure if all hive UDF's would work, but certainly this simple one does.

This takes a string and converts to lower case.

See the README.md for build information.

## Installation

See the instructions in each sub-project
